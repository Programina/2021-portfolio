        Hi, I am Amina Belabbes and I am passionate about making the web a more beautiful, easy to use and fun place. I love creating designs that make an impact üòä .
        I'm a full-time frontend developer with 2+ years of professional experience and about half a year of experience as a UX Designer, looking to transition into UX design.

      <p>I got my Master‚Äôs degree in Translation Studies, specializing in Computer Science, so technically I should have had a little bit of knowledge. Unfortunately, most of it got lost during the six years I spent working as a translator and a PA prior to working in development. So by now, most of my knowledge on both design and programming is self-taught.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had set out to become a translator. I had passed my degree and felt qualified to translate. What I did not feel qualified for was programming or designing. I usually give it my all, once my mind is set on a goal. But I really did not think I was fit to pursue a career in tech, back then. As a result, I ended up spending six years in jobs involving translation and assistance, always being ‚Äúthe nerdy one‚Äù. That ended up making me feel really unfulfilled, so I decided to find a way to get into software development. Development not so much because I did not consider design, but because I had taken more classes in development rather than design back in the day and I felt it was, again, the ‚Äúsafe way‚Äù to getting a foot in the door.

          <h3>Sources I use for education on UX and development</h3>
          <p>I found that having projects I really wanted to see come to life were my greatest motivator to progress. However, I would have never gotten very far without the internet and all the free and high-quality opportunities to learn.</p>
