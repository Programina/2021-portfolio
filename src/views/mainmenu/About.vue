      <p class="my-5">Hi, I am Amina. I a frontend developer and UX designer from Germany with 3 years of experience as a developer and half a year experience as a designer. I am currently employed full-time, but feel free to get in touch, I am always open to hear how I can help. üòä

    <p>  
      I am largely self-taught. Working in software, you never stop learning. However, I also have a Master's degree and a little background in IT and Design. For a more precise overview, have a look at my    <a

      I printed my first business card calling myself "Web Designer" when I was still at university, could not stop talking to everyone about the importance of user experience, since I started developing. 
      I even applied to a couple of design jobs, having nothing but a prototype I created on <a href="https://marvelapp.com/prototype/60c71ad/screen/38925966" style="text-transform: inherit; color: #3bcea0 !important">Marvel</a>. Needless to say, I needed a portfolio and more structured education.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took me even longer to admit that my deepest desire was to create and to make people happy and satisfied along the way. I do not feel complete unless I also design. 
      What gave me confidence to explore that side of me, was learning that creativity was a structured process that did not depend on luck or subjectivity.

          I found that having projects I really wanted to see come to life were
          my greatest motivator to progress. However, I would have never gotten
          very far without the internet and all the free and high-quality
          opportunities to learn.
