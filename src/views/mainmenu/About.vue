        Hi, I am Amina Belabbes and I am passionate about making the web a more beautiful, easy to use and fun place.

        I love designing and developing, but what I really love is putting a smile on people‚Äôs faces. üòä Professionally, I am frontend developer and I am currently employed full-time. I am also an aspiring designer with a little bit of professional experience designing interfaces from my first job.

        <span>I got my Master‚Äôs degree in Translation Studies. Languages had been a thing in my family, so it seemed like a no-brainer at the time. 
        Translation Studies allowed for a specialization and I chose Computer Science. Since the day I laid hands on a computer at around 7 years old, I‚Äôd always loved working with software. My university offered a handful of classes in web design and programming, I took all of them and was on fire!

        I had set out to become a translator. I had passed my degree and felt qualified to translate. What I did not feel qualified for was programming or designing. I usually give it my all, once my mind is set on a goal. But I really did not think I was fit to pursue a career in tech, back then. As a result, I ended up spending six years in jobs involving translation and assistance, always being ‚Äúthe nerdy one‚Äù. That ended up making me feel really unfulfilled, so I decided to find a way to get into software development. Development not so much because I did not consider design, but because I had taken more classes in development rather than design back in the day and I felt it was, again, the ‚Äúsafe way‚Äù to getting a foot in the door.
